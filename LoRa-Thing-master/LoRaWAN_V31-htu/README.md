# LoRaWAN Sensor

January 2016

This sketch implement the receiver/sender function for a LoRa node reporting
temperature and humidity functions to the LoRaWAN network.

The sketch implements the LoRa software based on a library of Hoperf.nl (for Nexus) on a Arduino
Nano MCU. As the amount of memory is limited on a Nano, the software is limited in its function and
will not support multi-channel etc.
